% to forward future messages to the client. 
% - It must also dump the channel state using the 
% ClientState#client_state.module:send/2
% Note that these two actions must be done in a single
% call (gen_server:cast, gen_fsm:send_event) for a perfect synchronisation.
% It is better to use a asynchronous call to not block the supercast_mpd during
