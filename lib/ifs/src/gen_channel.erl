% To implement a gen_channel a module must:
% <ul>
% <li>
%   also be a gen_server and understand these call/2
%   <ul>
%       <li>
%           call(Pid, get_perms), wich will return the #perm_conf{} 
%           restriction. This will tell ifs_mpd if the client is allowed to 
%           subscribe.
%       </li>
%       <li>
%           cast(Pid, {synchronize, CState}). When receiving this message, 
%           the module can eventualy send data to the client. After returning,
%           the module can send his periodic events and be sure the client is 
%           in sync.
%           Sending message should be done with ifs_mpd:unicast_msg/2 if the 
%           sender want ifs_mpd to filter message using the user_roles.
%       </li>
%   </ul>
% </li>
% <li>
%       Send every events of interest for clients in with the following funs:
%       <ul>
%           <li>
%               ifs_mpd:unicast_msg/2
%           </li>
%           <li>
%               ifs_mpd:multicast_msg/3
%           </li>
%       </ul>
